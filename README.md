# Retail Sales Analysis | SQL Data Analyst Portfolio

## Project Overview
This portfolio project focuses on retail sales data analysis using PostgreSQL, simulating real-world data analyst workflows. I designed and implemented a complete analysis pipeline, from database setup and data cleaning to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and business-focused querying, to uncover sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance insights.

The project showcases my proficiency in SQL fundamentals and advanced techniques, as well as my ability to connect data analysis to business decision-making—critical for driving retail business growth.

## Core Objectives
1. Design and implement a retail sales database to store transactional data efficiently.
2. Perform data cleaning to ensure data accuracy and reliability for analysis.
3. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand dataset characteristics and identify initial patterns.
4. Develop targeted SQL queries to answer business-critical questions and extract actionable insights.
5. Present findings in a clear, concise manner that aligns with business stakeholders’ needs.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
1. SQL (PostgreSQL): Database creation, table design, and data population.
2. Data Cleaning: Identifying and removing null/missing values to ensure data integrity.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using aggregate functions to summarize dataset metrics.
4. Advanced SQL Techniques: Window functions (RANK), CTEs, CASE statements, GROUP BY, and filtering to solve complex business problems.
5. Business Acumen: Translating retail business questions into technical SQL queries and deriving actionable insights.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `sql_project_p1`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sql_project_p1;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS retail_sales;
CREATE TABLE retail_sales
  (
	transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	sale_date	DATE,
	sale_time	TIME,
	customer_id	INT,
	gender	VARCHAR(15),
	age	INT,
	category VARCHAR(15),	
	quantiy	INT,
	price_per_unit	FLOAT,
	cogs	FLOAT,
	total_sale FLOAT
  );
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    transactions_id IS NULL
    OR
    sale_date IS NULL
    OR 
    sale_time IS NULL
    OR
    gender IS NULL
    OR
    category IS NULL
    OR
    quantiy IS NULL
    OR
    cogs IS NULL
    OR
    total_sale IS NULL;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    transactions_id IS NULL
    OR
    sale_date IS NULL
    OR 
    sale_time IS NULL
    OR
    gender IS NULL
    OR
    category IS NULL
    OR
    quantiy IS NULL
    OR
    cogs IS NULL
    OR
    total_sale IS NULL;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05'**:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales
where sale_date = '2022-11-05'
```

2. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    category = 'Clothing'
    AND 
    TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
    AND
    quantiy >= 4
```

3. **Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category**:
```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) as total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category
```

4. **Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category**:
```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(age),2) as avg_age
FROM retail_sales
WHERE category = 'Beauty'
```

5. **Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000**:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000
```

6. **Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category**:
```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    gender,
    COUNT(*) as total_trans
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 
    category,
    gender
ORDER BY category
```

7. **Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year**:
```sql
SELECT 
       year,
       month,
       avg_sale
FROM 
(    
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) as month,
    AVG(total_sale) as avg_sale,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) as rank
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1, 2
) as t1
WHERE rank = 1
ORDER BY 3 DESC
```

8. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales**:
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_sale) as total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5
```

9. **Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category**:
```sql
SELECT 
    category,    
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as cnt_unique_cs
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category
```

10. **Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)**:
```sql
WITH hourly_sale
AS
(
SELECT *,
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END as shift
FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT 
    shift,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders    
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift
```

## Findings

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
- **Customer Insights**: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

## Reports

- **Sales Summary**: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
- **Trend Analysis**: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.
- **Customer Insights**: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to SQL for data analysts, covering database setup, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries.
